## Future Directions

Potential extensions of this work include:
- Longitudinal designs tracking within-person changes in listening behavior and emotional state over time.
- Demographic or contextual subgroup analyses where sample sizes permit.
- Incorporating finer-grained musical features (e.g., tempo, familiarity, lyrical content) beyond genre labels.
